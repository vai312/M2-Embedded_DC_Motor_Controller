# Requirements
## Introduction
 Controlling direction and speed of DC motor is very essential in many applications like, Robotic application – to change direction and speed of moving robot. Industrial application – to change direction and speed of rotating machinery· Domestic application – to vary speed of portable fan· Defence application – to rotate radar, automatic gun, tank gun in either direction· Communication application – rotate dish antenna upward – downward or clockwise – anticlockwise. 
  So this project demonstrates how to vary the speed and change the direction of DC motor using AVR microcontroller ATmega328.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is:
1. To change the speed of the motor as per the need of the application.
2. To change the direction of rotation of the motor as per the need of the application.
3. To save the energy of the battery.
4. To increase the life of the battery.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
### Strength
1. It can change the speed of the motor as per the need of the application.
2. It can change the direction of rotation of the motor as per the need of the application.
### Weakness
1. It is only for a small rating of dc motor.
2. Sudden stoppage of the motor is not possible.
3. There is no feature to increase speed above the rating

### Opportunities
1. A wide range of speed controllers can be made for high rating of a motor.
2. Multiple motors can be controlled.
### Threats
1. A wide range of speed controller for the high rating of a motor is already available in the market.
## Who:
1. The person who has basic knowledge of speed controlling.
2. The person who wants to change the speed of appliances on which he working.
## What:
1. To get controllable speed.
2. To change direction and speed of moving robot. 
## When:
1. When there is a need for a change in speed.
2. When there is a need to control speed and direction of motor as per requirement.
## Where:
1. For domestic purposes.
2. For Industrial purposes.
3. For defense purposes.

## How:
1. Using ATmega328 as a controller to control the speed and direction dc motor.
