# Requirements
## Introduction
 Controlling direction and speed of DC motor is very essential in many applications like, Robotic application – to change direction and speed of moving robot. Industrial application – to change direction and speed of rotating machinery· Domestic application – to vary speed of portable fan· Defence application – to rotate radar, automatic gun, tank gun in either direction· Communication application – rotate dish antenna upward – downward or clockwise – anticlockwise. 
  So this project demonstrates how to vary the speed and change the direction of DC motor using AVR microcontroller ATmega328.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is:
1. To change the speed of the motor as per the need of the application.
2. To change the direction of rotation of the motor as per the need of the application.
3. To save the energy of the battery.
4. To increase the life of the battery.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
### Strength
1. It can change the speed of the motor as per the need of the application.
2. It can change the direction of rotation of the motor as per the need of the application.
### Weakness
1. It is only for a small rating of dc motor.
2.
